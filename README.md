# ERC404 Builder | BNB Hackathon Submission 🚀

## Overview 🌐

Our innovative application facilitates no-code deployment of ERC404 token smart contracts on the BNB blockchain, enhancing the liquidity of NFTs by enabling them to be traded on both NFT marketplaces and decentralized exchanges. This user-friendly app allows for the creation of tokens without any coding requirements. Users simply input details such as token name, symbol, max supply, and base URI (containing the assets of the NFT collection) to deploy ERC404 token smart contracts with a single click. 🖱️
